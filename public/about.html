<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Stephen Mujeye Jr, I am a curious soul with a passion for marketing and an evolving journey into the tech universe.
  In 2022, I proudly graduated from the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee with a degree in Marketing, setting the stage for a career filled with exploration and growth.
  My initial foray into the professional world led me to Brady Corporation, where I immersed myself in paid search marketing via Google Ads, 
  sculpted impactful email marketing strategies, and delved into research for trade publications, all aimed at driving sales. 
  These experiences not only polished my marketing acumen but also sparked a desire to broaden my horizons.</p>

<p>Transitioning to the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, I embraced the world of project management, collaborating with diverse teams to achieve organizational goals. 
  Each interaction was a lesson in teamwork and coordination, shaping me into a more versatile and effective professional.
  The pursuit of knowledge and a keen interest in the intersection of IT and marketing led me to explore tech skills.
  Through a 61.5-hour boot camp, I am diving into HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and DApps. 
  This journey not only expanded my technical expertise but also allowed me to showcase my work in an online portfolio, a testament to my commitment and creativity.</p>
